# Quantum ML&Computing Learning
Python code for quantum machine learning and Quleaf quantum circuit demostration for quantum computing algorithms


## Quantum Classifier
Apply the quantum classifier to kaggle titanic dataset. 

Original document site:[https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-classifier.html](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-classifier.html)

Structure of quantum circuit is similar to [VSQL: Variational Shadow Quantum Learning for Classification](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.17016)



## Single Qubit QNN
A method to fit function using single qubit circuit.

Original document site:[https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-neural-network-approximating-functions.html](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-neural-network-approximating-functions.html)

Differences from the document: add a constant coefficient and a bias to the final output in order to fit functions in wider range


## Deutsch-Joza Algorithm
A demostration of Deutsch-Joza algorithm on Baidu Quleaf

The md file is the explanation of some theory and how to demostrate the algorithm on Quleaf.

Code for build the ciruit in QComposer on Quleaf can be found at Quleaf_Code_balanced and Quleaf_Code_constant
