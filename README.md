## Quantum Classifier
Original document site:[https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-classifier.html](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-classifier.html)

Apply the quantum classifier to kaggle titanic dataset. Structure of quantum circuit is similar to [VSQL: Variational Shadow Quantum Learning for Classification](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i9.17016)


## Single Qubit QNN
A method to fit function using single qubit circuit.

Original document site:[https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-neural-network-approximating-functions.html](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/machine-learning/quantum-neural-network-approximating-functions.html)

Differences from the document: add a constant coefficient and a bias to the final output in order to fit functions in wider range
